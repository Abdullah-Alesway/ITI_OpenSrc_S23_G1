**And for who don't know what the H*ll of the this**:
Summer Code-Camps [ITI](https://iti.gov.eg/):
ITI Summer Code-Camps was initiated as one of the most ambitious programs that inspires Egyptian youth in Universities 
to deepen their technological knowledge and shape their careers in the competitive ICT markets. In cooperation 
with the Supreme Council of Universities, we provide comprehensive services that goes beyond transferring 
knowledge into fostering excellence through training, Career Clinics, and career talks during their mid-year and summer 
vacation in highly demanded skills to increase their readiness prior their graduation. 

**To summarize, this is a new technique from Government to wasting taxpayers' money :money_mouth_face:**.
